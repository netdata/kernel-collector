# User Ring

Inside this directory we have auxiliar tools used for SRE-team, but initially this was the directory used
to make the collectors and we kept it as the main directory to compile the shared libraries and the eBPF
programs.

## Makefile

The `Makefile` has instructions to go into all directories and make the object codes and shared libraries
necessaries to run Netdata ebpf collectors
