##### Summary

##### Test Plan
1. Get binaries according your LIBC from [this](ADD ACTIONS LINK HERE) link and extract them inside a `directory`.
You can also get everything for glibc [here](UPLOAD FILE WITH ALL BINARIES TO SIMPLIFY REVIEWERS).

2. Extract them running:
    ```sh
    $ for i in `ls *.zip`; do unzip $i; rm .gitkeep ; rm $i; done
    $ for i in `ls *.xz`; do tar -xf $i; rm $i* ; done
    ```

3. Compile branch an run the following tests:

    ```sh
    # make clean; make tester
    # for i in `seq 0 2`; do ./kernel/legacy_test --netdata-path ../directory --content --iteration --pid $i --log-path file_pid$i.txt; done
    ```

4. Every test should ends with `Success`, unless you do not have a specific target (function) available.
